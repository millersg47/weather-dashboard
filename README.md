# WEATHER-DASHBOARD

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This webpage is a weather dashboard that loads the current and forecasted weather data for a location based on a user's city search input. When the user searches a city, the weather info loads incluidng temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index and an icon depicting overall weather conditions. The UV index includes a background color indicating its severity. The user's searched city populates in the search history below the search bar. These buttons are clickable and will load that location's weather data again.

The webpage is linked [here](https://millersg47.github.io/weather-dashboard/).
